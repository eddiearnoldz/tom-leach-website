    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Tom Leach, I'm a recording and mixing engineer based at Snap Studios in London, as well several other studios, including Miloco Studios, AIR Studios and Red Bull Studios. Music has always been my absolute passion, whether it's playing, recording or listening. Having trained in Manchester, It's my pleasure to work with live tracks, post production, through to full records and production.</p>
    <p>Over my career so far, I've been fortunate to have  worked with artists and producers like Fergie, Lewis Capaldi, Burna Boy, Headie One, Pa Salieu, Tion Wayne, Wheatus, Shy FX, Mr Scruff, FKA Twigs, Years and Years, Stormzy, Wretch 32, Clean Bandit, Deaf Havana, Spiritualized, Beth Gibbons, James Ford, Jerry Boys, Haydn Bendall and many, many others.</p>
    <p>I'm at home working on everything from Rock to EDM, hip hop to classical to big band and everything in between. Check out some of my work on the next page.</p>
    <p>I'm one half of 9 Pockets, a production duo working on everything from major label releases to sync and score composition. More info on 9 Pockets here: <a href="https://9pockets.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://9pockets.co.uk/</a></p>
